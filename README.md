If we are going to deploy this on production, what do you think is the next improvement that you will prioritize next?

1. User should be given an option to enter values for salary (monthly/daily rates) and tax. These should be dynamic values.
2. Overtime pay and night differential should be considered.
3. Addition of employee search functionality
4. Bulk creation of employees
   - upload of an excel file that contains employee data would be ingested.
6. Stricter field validations
   - checking of valid TIN
   - checking of duplicate records based on an identifier (employee ID or TIN)
7. Individual and/or batch printing/exporting of employee payslip
